    <h2>Java Fundamentals I: Hello World</h2>
    <br>
    This guide discusses the fundamentals of Java Programming within the context of FIRST Robotics Competition.  
    This guide will walk you through the task 'Hello World', printing those very words into the terminal of your IDE/Compiler. 
    <br> 
    <h3>Classes</h3>
    Within Java, all code is contained within a method of a class.  
    For the moment, we will be focusing on classes.  
    <br>
    In Java, a Class is functionally the template for an Object.  
    We’ll discuss objects more in just a minute, but for the moment, you can consider them to be a combination of a data set and the operations you can perform on that data (the methods mentioned above).  
    Thus, a class is where we determine what data is being tracked and what operations can be performed.  
    Specifically, within FRC, classes are what we use to program specific mechanisms and functions of the robot, such as the drivetrain, pivoting arm, or vision.
    <div class="code">
        public class main { <br>
        <br>
        }
    </div>
    This code is an example of how you would format a class.  
    The declaration of a class consists of an access modifier, which will either be Private or, in most cases, Public, its definition as a class, and its name, in our case Main.
    <br>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    Next, we are going to discuss methods in depth.
    Methods are functions that can be performed on an object, such as mathematical operations or returning values for usage elsewhere.
    <div class="code">
        public class main { <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">public static void main(Sting[] args) {</p> 
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 15px;">}</p>
        } 
    </div>
    This code within the class we created earlier is an example of a method. A method is formatted as follows: an access modifier, usually public; possibly its status as a static method, meaning it is called automatically when an object is created; the data type it returns, in this case we don’t need this method to output a value, so it is listed as void; the name of the method, in this case main, and, in parentheses, any parameters that the method may take. This method, in particular, serves a special purpose as the code’s main method, from which all code is initialized. Thus, nothing in code can happen unless it originates from this method in some way. This method is always formatted as it is here, and the slightest difference would prevent your code from running at all.
    <div class="code">
        public class main { <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 15px;">public static void main(Sting[] args) {</p> 
        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">System.out.println;</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 15px;">}</p>
        }
    </div>
    Now that you know how to define a method, you may be wondering how we call one. Within our lovely main method, we are going to be doing just that. We are going to be calling the method to print text to our code terminal. As this is a method of the System.out object, we have to make sure that it is clear in the code what object the method we are calling belongs to. Thus, we write that we are referencing System.out, and that we are calling the println method, thus giving us System.out.println. From there, we add some parentheses containing the method’s parameters, in this case the text that we want to print, ‘Hello World’ in our case, and close the line with a semicolon. From here, if we run our code, you can see that hello world gets printed to the terminal.
