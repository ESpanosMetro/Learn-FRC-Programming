    <h2>Creating Educational Resources for FIRST Robotics Competition Programming</h2>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    Programming in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is in many ways very distinct from normal programming. It is heavily dependant on a unique library, called WPILib, purpose built for FRC Programming. This library, developed by students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, introduces several new Classes and Tools to Java, all of serve to remove the tedium of directly programming a complex robot. This library is fairly well documented, though much of its official documentation is severely outdated given updates to the tools provided. Several resources exist to help those learning how to program using WPILib, and many of these resources convey information perfectly well to those who are already familiar with programming. Many of them, however, fall short when it comes to instructing those who lack this prior knowledge of programming.
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    The Goal of this Project:
    <ul>
        <li>Create educational resources for FRC programming that are thoroughly comprehensible to those who lack experience with programming in general. This should be done in a combined written and video format.
            <ul>
                <li>Determine what is of sufficient difficulty that programmers may encounter difficulty as opposed to that which they can learn on their own. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Develop a way for new programmers to experiment with robot code without the need for a robot on which they can test.</li>
        <li>Create a directory for the above resources that can be easily accessed and navigated by those looking to learn.</li>
        
    </ul>
